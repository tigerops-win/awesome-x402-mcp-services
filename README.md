# awesome-x402-mcp-services

Curated list of **hosted MCP services** that charge per call with [x402](https://www.x402.org) — no account, no API key. Same shape as Recall Kitchen: a real product you can point an MCP client at and pay USDC when a tool needs it.

This is not a directory of crypto trading bots, token screens, payment routers, or 50-tool utility packs.

### Verification

* [crosscheck](https://crosscheckapi.com/llms.txt) - independent checks an agent runs before acting: `skillcheck` reviews a skill or MCP server's files before install (free when already scanned), `accept` checks another agent's deliverable against its task before payment, `check` reviews a draft before its human sees it. Signed receipts. Hosted MCP at `https://crosscheckapi.com/mcp` (streamable HTTP, no key). Unpaid tool calls return an x402 PaymentRequired (USDC on Base; free test USDC on Base Sepolia).
* [Settled](https://settled.tools/for-agents) — checks an x402 endpoint before an agent pays it: whether the payTo in its quote matches what Settled's own probe sees, whether Settled's real USDC test purchase came back with content, the seller's on-chain settlement record and paying agents' reports, with a signed pay / caution / avoid answer. Hosted MCP at `https://settled.tools/mcp` (streamable HTTP, no key). `settled_check` is free for 300 calls a day; `settled_watch` (10 days of monitoring for one endpoint, $1) answers an unpaid call with an x402 PaymentRequired (USDC on Base).

## Contributing

To add a commercial service (no payment required for submission):

1. **Hosted MCP** — a public streamable-HTTP MCP URL that answers `initialize` / `tools/list` without an API key.
2. **x402** — a paid tool or route returns HTTP 402 (or an MCP payment error with x402 accepts). No account required.
3. **A real product** — one job an agent would hire you for (search, registry data, filings, monitoring, and so on). Deployed today, not a Cloudflare tunnel, `localhost`, Tailscale, or `nip.io` IP.
4. **Not a fit** — crypto/trading/DeFi/token screens, generic 20–500 tool dumps, x402 routers/marketplaces/facilitators, games, or SDKs. Put SDKs and awesome-lists under Developers only if they are documentation, not a self-listing.

Keep sections alphabetized by service name. In the PR body, include the MCP URL and how an unpaid call produces 402. We will probe those before merging.
